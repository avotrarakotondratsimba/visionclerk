# VisionClerk

## Description

VisionClerk is a full-stack web application that performs real-time object detection using a webcam feed. It leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence directly in the browser, identifies objects using the COCO-SSD model, and provides a history of the detection results.

## Key Features

* **Real-Time Webcam Detection:** Identifies objects in real-time through the user's webcam.
* **AI Model Integration:** Uses the pre-trained COCO-SSD model via TensorFlow.js for accurate object recognition.
* **Canvas Rendering:** Manages the rendering of bounding boxes and labels on an HTML canvas to visualize detections.
* **Detection History:** Saves the results of detection sessions for later review.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, TensorFlow.js
* **Backend:** Express.js
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
